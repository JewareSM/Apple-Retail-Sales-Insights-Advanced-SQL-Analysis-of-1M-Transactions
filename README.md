# 👋Introduction
  Welcome to my SQL-powered data analytics project focused on Apple Retail Sales and Warranty Insights.
  In this project, I explored a large-scale dataset comprising over 1 million records from Apple’s global retail operations. The goal was to solve business-critical questions using structured and optimized SQL 
  queries.

# 📊 What This Project Covers
  This project offers a comprehensive hands-on experience with SQL in a real-world retail context. Key areas of focus include :
  
  ✅ Practical application of advanced SQL concepts (JOINs, aggregations, window functions, subqueries)
  
  💼 Solving realistic business scenarios involving sales trends, product performance, and warranty behavior
  
  🧠 Structured query writing, optimization, and performance analysis using EXPLAIN ANALYZE

# 🚀 Project Overview
  This project demonstrates advanced SQL querying techniques by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of over 1 million records from Apple’s global retail operations. The dataset includes information on products, 
  stores, sales transactions, and warranty claims across multiple countries.
  By solving a wide range of business questions—from foundational queries to complex analytical tasks—this project highlights the ability to write structured, optimized SQL queries that uncover meaningful 
  insights from large-scale data.
  The project is ideal for data analysts looking to enhance their SQL skills by working with a large-scale dataset and solving real-world business questions.

   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS products;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS category;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stores;

-- CREATE TABLE: stores
CREATE TABLE stores (
    store_id VARCHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY,
    store_name VARCHAR(30),
    city VARCHAR(25),
    country VARCHAR(25)
);

-- CREATE TABLE: category
CREATE TABLE category (
    category_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(20)
);

# ✅ Business Problems & Solutions 
## 📊 Basic to Intermediate

```sql
-- Q1. FIND THE NUMBER OF STORES IN EACH COUNTRY.

SELECT country, COUNT(store_id) AS number_of_stores
FROM stores
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY number_of_stores DESC;

-- Q2. CALCULATE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD BY EACH STORE.

SELECT s.store_id,st.store_name,SUM(s.quantity) AS total_units_sold
FROM sales AS s
JOIN stores AS st
ON  s.store_id = st.store_id 
GROUP BY s.store_id , st.store_name
ORDER BY total_units_sold DESC;

-- Q3. IDENTIFY HOW MANY SALES OCCURRED IN DECEMBER 2023.

SELECT COUNT(sale_id) AS total_sales_dec23 
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-12-01' AND '2023-12-31';

OR

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales_december_2023
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date >= '2023-12-01' AND sale_date < '2024-01-01';

OR

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales_december_2023
FROM sales
WHERE TO_CHAR(sale_date,'MM-YYYY') = '12-2023';


-- Q4. DETERMINE HOW MANY STORES HAVE NEVER HAD A WARRANTY CLAIM FILED.
